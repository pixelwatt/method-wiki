And we're live! Finally. What started out as a project with a maximum of 30 pages quickly turned into more than double that and, well, I'm sure you know the rest. The end result is a mostly-complete documentation site that will get the rest of the way there in the coming weeks. In the meantime, have a look around, play with some code, and report any issues you happen to come across to me using GitHub's Issues tab.
