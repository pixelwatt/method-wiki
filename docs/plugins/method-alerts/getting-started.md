# Method Alerts

This WordPress plugin implements a system for displaying alerts on specific pages or posts, loading alerts from a static json file via the browser to keep performance impact low. Because the performance burden is offset onto the user's browser, agressive server-side caching can be safely maintained without having any effect on alerts.

***

## Requirments

* The CMB2 plugin must be installed for this plugin for function correctly.
* Your site's theme needs to be built using Bootstrap 5 for alerts to appear correctly. Alternately, you can download Bootstrap 5's alert styles and add them to your theme.
