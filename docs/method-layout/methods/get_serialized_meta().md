`public function get_serialized_meta( $key )`

This method allows you to quickly retrieve and unserialize serialized post meta for the current post. If the meta key doesn't exist, or is empty, the method returns false. To retrieve post meta that does not need to be unserialized, use the [get_meta()](/docs/method-layout/methods/get_meta()) method.

:::caution Only Pass Trusted Input

Please be aware that the value of the requested meta key will be passed through the [maybe_unserialize()](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/maybe_unserialize/) function.
