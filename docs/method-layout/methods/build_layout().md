`protected function build_layout()`

This method is called by the build_page() method after all layout attributes have been determined. This method has no arguments and simply runs the [build_header()](/docs/method-layout/methods/build_header()), [build_components()](/docs/method-layout/methods/build_components()), and [build_footer()](/docs/method-layout/methods/build_footer()) methods. It most likely will never need to be called directly.
