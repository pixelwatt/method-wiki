# Welcome

Welcome to the Method wiki. I've taken a lot of cues from the [WordPress Codex](https://developer.wordpress.org/), especially for method documentation, so hopefully this provides you with a solid knowledgebase to work from. This is currently a work in progress, so some documentation may be missing.

## Getting Started

- [About Method](/docs/getting-started/about_method)
- [Installation](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [File Structure Overview](/docs/getting-started/file-organization)
- [Functions.php Structure](/docs/getting-started/functions-structure)

## References

- [Included Libraries](/docs/other-references/included-libraries)
- [Helper Functions](/docs/other-references/helper-functions)
