# Documentation Changelog

***

Changes:
* Minor CSS tweaks added to increase readability. This includes improved margins for `<hr>` elements, and a new link color for light mode.
* Linked method references in the template building file that weren't already linked.
* Worked on improving method documentation. Eventually, each page in the methods section will have the same overall format ( overview / arguments / return / example ), and warnings will be displayed for any method that calls maybe_unserialize().
